This is an attempt to bring Policy Based Network Management (PBNM) principles and research into Node.js
Using JSONP, we will author Policy documents for interpretation by a node.js program. The following directory structure  is available:

- Testing: General testing area files here may not work and represnt emerging ideas
- Architecture: The PBNM Node.js Architecture will be stored here. Initially the PRP and PIP will be present
- Resources: A full suite of XML and translated JSON policy requests will be stored here.

Repository created: 10-June-2011.

Files will be updated periodically for testing and a means of mutual resource access so do not use this software
or any components until a beta deploy is available.
