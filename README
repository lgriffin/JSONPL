This is an attempt to bring Policy Based Network Management (PBNM) principles and research into Node.js
Using JSONP, we will author Policy documents for interpretation by a node.js program. The following directory structure  is available:

- Testing: General testing area files here may not work and represnt emerging ideas
- Architecture: The PBNM Node.js Architecture will be stored here. Initially the PRP and PIP will be present
- Resources: A full suite of XML and translated JSON policy requests will be stored here.

Repository created: 10-June-2011.

@leighgriffin or email lgriffin(at)tssg(dot)org


Files will be updated periodically for testing and a means of mutual resource access so do not use this software
or any components until a beta deploy is available.

The PDP implementation will be kept seperate from this project.
The repository https://github.com/lgriffin/PDP.js will be used for all
PDP related discussion.
